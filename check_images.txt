Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: I uploaded the Chihuahua dog photo. The VGG model architecture and Alexnet model architecture classify the breed of dog to be the same breed with 100% accuracy. But the Resnet model architecture misclassifies the photo with "pomeranian" which is very similar to "Chihuahua". 


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: All the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg(Chihuahua_01.jpg for me) to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg(Chihuahua_01.jpg for me) - which is the upside-down photo of the Dog_01.jpg(Chihuahua_01.jpg for me).


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: The three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg(Monkey_01.jpg for me) and Object_Name_01.jpg(Table_01.jpg for me) to not be dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: For me, the Alexnet model architecture is the best at classifying the four uploaded images. It takes not only less time to process but also has the 100% accuracy for both breed classification and dog or not-dog classification. Even though the VGG model architecture has the same accuracy as the Alexnet, it takes a bit more time(wich is 3 seconds) than the Alexnet model architecture.
